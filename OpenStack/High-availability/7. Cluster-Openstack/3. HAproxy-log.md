## 1. HAProxy Log Level

  

- Trên HAproxy dựa vào level để trả về message.

|**Severity Level**| **HAProxy Logs** |
|--|---|
|emerg| Errors such as running out of operating system file descriptors. |
|alert|Some rare cases where something unexpected has happened, such as being unable to cache a response.|
|err|Errors such as being unable to parse a map file, being unable to parse the HAProxy configuration file, and when an operation on a stick table fails.|
|warning|Certain important, but non-critical, errors such as failing to set a request header or failing to connect to a DNS nameserver.|
|notice|Changes to a server’s state, such as being UP or DOWN or when a server is disabled. Other events at startup, such as starting proxies and loading modules are also included. Health check logging, if enabled, also uses this level.|
|info|TCP connection and HTTP request details and errors.|
|debug|TCP connection and HTTP request details and errors.|



## 2. Cấu hình LOG

  

- Cài đặt rsyslog

```
yum install -y rsyslog
```

 
- Khởi tạo rsyslog file để xử lý HAproxy log

```
cat <<EOF> /etc/rsyslog.d/haproxy.conf

# Collect log with UDP

\$ModLoad imudp

\$UDPServerAddress 127.0.0.1

\$UDPServerRun 514

 
# Creating separate log files based on the severity

local0.log /var/log/haproxy-traffic.log

local0.notice /var/log/haproxy-admin.log

EOF
```

- Khởi động lại rsyslog
```
systemctl restart rsyslog
```

  
- Cấu hình HAproxy `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

```
...
global
	log 127.0.0.1:514 local0 log
	log 127.0.0.1:514 local0 notice

...
```

- Khởi động lại HAproxy
```
systemctl restart haproxyy
```
